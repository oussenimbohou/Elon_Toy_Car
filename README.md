In this exercise you'll be playing around with a remote controlled car, which you've finally saved enough money for to buy.  Cars start with full (100%) batteries. Each time you drive the car using the remote control, it covers 20 meters and drains one percent of the battery.  The remote controlled car has a fancy LED display that shows two bits of information:  The total distance it has driven, displayed as: "Driven &lt;METERS> meters". The remaining battery charge, displayed as: "Battery at &lt;PERCENTAGE>%". If the battery is at 0%, you can't drive the car anymore and the battery display will show "Battery empty".
